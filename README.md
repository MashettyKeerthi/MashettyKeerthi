### 💡 About Me

🧠 A detail-driven problem solver who believes that every dataset hides a story — and I love being the one to uncover it.

💬 Fun fact: I treat every messy dataset like a mystery novel — and I won’t stop until I find the plot twist. 😄

🤝 Always open to connecting, collaborating, or just talking data!
